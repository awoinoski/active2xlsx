We want a program that is capable of taking infomation exported from active
as a CSV file and format it into a .xlsx file. Active can export a few 
difference reports. This includes:

1. Athlete Roster
2. Medical/Emergency Contacts
3. Athlete Waivers
4. Top Times Spreadsheet
5. Top Times Rankings 
6. Top Times By Name
7. Meet Entries


This information can be used in many ways. Here are some of the items I
would like to include in the project.

1. Comprehenisve swimmer swimmer information sheet
	This sheet would include things like names, DOB, age as of May 1st, Div,
	BCSSA ID, guardians name, gender, home phone number, cell number, and 
	Email. I would like the sheet to be formated to allow to sort and filter
	by column in excel or google sheets.
	
2. Swimmer rankings by event
	This sheet would include a mens and womens sheets and would rank all 
	swimmers in each event. It should be formated so that swimmer division
	is included and can be used to filter and sort by division.
	
3. Swimmer precent away from PQT
	This sheet would include each swimmers precent away from this years 
	PQT's. Again enable the ability for the user to be able to filter and
	sort.

4. Swimmer relay builder
	This sheet might be more challanging. It should work well for div 3 and
	under. Basiclly we want to have a sheet outputed with the ideal relays
	given the meet sign-up and the previous best times of swimmers.
	
5. Preformance recap stats (number of meets swam)
	This sheet would include things like number of swim meets, number of
	best times, average precent improved in each event, number of races, and
	number of DQ's. I am not so sure about this one but would be cool to 
	have.
